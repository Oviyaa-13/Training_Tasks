# OOP CONCEPTS 

### Class 
A class is a blueprint for creating objects.It defines what an object should contain and what it can do.

### Object
It is an instance of the class which means it uses the blueprint to exist and work.

# 4 Main Pillars Of OOP

#### 1.Encapsulation
#### 2.Abstraction
#### 3.Inheritance
#### 4.Polymorphism

### 1.ENCAPSULATION 
#### Def : Encapsulation means binding data and methods into single unit and allowing controlled access to data through specific methods.
#### E.g : Medicine bottle ; Expln : Access to medicine is done after opening the cap , similarly we are making use of methods (getters,setters) to access private data.

### 2.ABSTRACTION 
#### Def : Abstraction means hiding all unneccessary details and showing only important/what's needed to the user.
#### E.g : Ordering food online ; Expln : We don't know how the order is processed , which kitchen it's going to ; the essential/important part we saw is selection of food items and the delivery time.

### 3.INHERITANCE
#### Def : Inheritance allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviour of another class . It promotes code reusabilty.
#### E.g : Parent and child ; Expln : Child inherits few traits from their parent.

### 4.POLYMORPHISM 
#### Def : Polymorphism means to exist in different forms . Methods with same name behave differently based on the object calling them.It is of 2 types : 1.Runtime polymorphism , 2. Compile time polymorphism.
#### E.g : A Person , Expln : A person can be an employee at an office , also can be a brother/sister to his/her siblings.
